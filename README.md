libretro-moonlight
==================

A port of Moonlight Embedded to libretro.

Thanks
------

Significant portions of this software have been based on [Moonlight Embedded][1],
and this project would not be possible without the base implementation of
[Moonlight][2].  Thanks to the authors and contributors of both projects.
